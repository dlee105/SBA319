Welcome to my MongoDB demonstration! 

This is an backend focus app that is uses MongoDB to manage information similarly to how an instructor class management tool works! 

## How It Works

There is currently 3 implemented CRUD calls for three sets of data (**user, courses, announcements**). Within the server folder, these data sets exists within ./routes and their schemas are implemented inside ./models. 

I've also implemented a frontend that utilized CORS in order to fetch API calls from your localhost:XXXX link! I implemented this to simplify and give you guys a quicker and more efficient way to test my API call without having to write the JSON body using an external API testing tool.


## How to use
> **INSTALLATION**
> 1. Fork the following project or download it as a .zip onto your local machine
> 2. cd ./server folder where server.js exists
> 3. run the command **npm install**
> 4. run the command **nodemon server.js**
> 5.  To use the frontend as a localhost:XXXX link, return to the main folder and cd into ./app then run the index.html as a liveserver
> 5. NOW YOU CAN USE THE WEBSITE
